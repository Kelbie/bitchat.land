# ChannelList Improvements

## Overview
The ChannelList component has been significantly enhanced with new functionality for better channel organization and user experience.

## New Features

### 1. Channel Pinning with Heart Icons ❤️
- **Heart Icon**: Each channel now displays a heart icon (🤍 for unpinned, ❤️ for pinned)
- **Click to Pin/Unpin**: Users can click the heart to pin or unpin channels
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Pinned channels are automatically saved to localStorage
- **Visual Feedback**: Pinned channels have distinct styling and appear in a dedicated section

### 2. Organized Channel Sections
The channel list is now organized into three distinct sections:

#### 📌 PINNED Section
- User-pinned channels appear at the top
- Distinct yellow styling to highlight importance
- Persisted across browser sessions

#### 🌍 GEOHASH Section
- Channels that are valid geohashes (using regex validation)
- Uses event kind **20000** for Nostr events
- Blue styling to distinguish from other channels
- Examples: `u4pru`, `dr5ru`, `9q8yy`

#### 📺 STANDARD Section
- Regular text channels (non-geohash)
- Uses event kind **23333** for Nostr events
- Gray styling for standard appearance
- Examples: `#nostr`, `#general`, `#random`

### 3. Event Kind Enforcement
- **Geohash Channels**: Use kind 20000 (based on actual event data)
- **Standard Channels**: Use kind 23333 (based on actual event data)
- **Accurate Detection**: Channel type is determined by the actual event kind, not just key format

### 4. Enhanced Visual Design
- **Section Headers**: Clear visual separation between channel types
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for each channel category
- **Responsive Layout**: Maintains existing responsive behavior
- **Theme Support**: Works with both Matrix and Material themes
- **Full Content Display**: Channel names are never truncated and use word-breaking for long names
- **Optimal Width**: Channel list width increased to 192px (w-48) to accommodate longer channel names

## Technical Implementation

### New Utility Files

#### `src/utils/pinnedChannels.ts`
- Manages pinned channels in localStorage
- Provides functions for adding/removing pinned channels
- Handles persistence and retrieval

#### `src/utils/channelCategorization.ts`
- Provides utility functions for channel categorization
- Contains geohash validation logic
- Used as fallback for channels without event kind data

#### `src/constants/eventKinds.ts`
- Defines constants for event kinds
- Makes the code more maintainable and readable

### Updated Components

#### `src/components/ChannelList.tsx`
- Complete rewrite with new functionality
- Section-based rendering
- Heart icon integration
- Enhanced styling and theming

### Key Functions

```typescript
// Pin/unpin a channel
const handleHeartClick = (e: React.MouseEvent, channelKey: string) => {
  if (pinnedChannels.includes(channelKey)) {
    removePinnedChannel(channelKey);
  } else {
    addPinnedChannel(channelKey);
  }
};

// Categorize channels
const categorized = categorizeChannels(allChannels, pinnedChannels);

// Get event kind for channel
const eventKind = getEventKindForChannel(channelKey);
```

## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```typescript
import { ChannelList, ChannelMeta } from "./components/ChannelList";

<ChannelList
  channels={channels}
  selectedChannel={selectedChannelKey}
  unreadCounts={unreadCounts}
  onOpenChannel={handleOpenChannel}
  theme={theme}
/>
```

### Channel Data Structure
```typescript
type ChannelMeta = {
  key: string;           // Channel identifier
  isPinned: boolean;     // Legacy field (now handled internally)
  hasMessages: boolean;  // Whether channel has messages
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Channels are logically grouped by type
2. **User Control**: Users can pin important channels for quick access
3. **Persistent State**: Pinned channels survive browser restarts
4. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Easy to distinguish between channel types
5. **Event Kind Compliance**: Automatic enforcement of correct Nostr event kinds
6. **Improved UX**: Heart icons provide intuitive pinning interface

## Migration Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing props and functionality preserved
- **Automatic Migration**: Pinned channels are automatically detected and categorized
- **Performance**: Minimal performance impact with efficient categorization

## Recent Fixes

### Event Kind Accuracy (Latest Update)
- **Problem**: Channels were being categorized based on key format rather than actual event kinds
- **Solution**: Updated to use actual event kind data from stored events
- **Result**: Channels now correctly show as geohash (kind 20000) or standard (kind 23333) based on their real event data
- **Implementation**: Added `eventKind` field to `ChannelMeta` type and updated categorization logic in App component

### Content Display Improvements (Latest Update)
- **Problem**: Channel names were being truncated and the channel list was too narrow
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed `channelName` from `"truncate"` to `"break-words"` to prevent truncation
  - Increased channel list width from 160px to 192px (w-40 → w-48)
  - Removed `min-w-0` constraint from `channelInfo` to allow content to expand
- **Result**: Full channel names are now visible with proper word-breaking for long names

## Future Enhancements

- **Drag & Drop**: Reorder channels within sections
- **Search/Filter**: Find channels quickly in large lists
- **Bulk Operations**: Pin/unpin multiple channels at once
- **Section Collapse**: Collapsible sections for better space management
- **Custom Categories**: User-defined channel groupings
